**Assessment 2 (Total Marks **50**)**

Assignment: **Software requirements analysis and design (**Full-Stack CRUD Application Development with DevOps Practices**)**


Assignment Objective:

To simulate the real-world software development lifecycle by collaboratively designing,
developing, and deploying an object-oriented application using advanced OOP concepts, popular
design patterns, software testing, and GitHub for version control. The project will also involve
creating a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documentation and UI/UX prototyping
using Figma

Task Overview:

Step                                                                         What to Do
SRS documentation                                                            You can follow the SRS template for documentation and list out all user stories related to your selected project.
Make a UI/UX design and prototyping of your software                         Design Landing Page / Dashboard and other Functional UI components from your SRS documentation.
Map Features->Problem->Patterns                                              Use the design pattern matrix of the following for mapping your functional development.
Select at least 7 Design Patterns for implementing backend                   Pick ones that make sense for their solution.
Connect Patterns with OOP and implementation of OOP in the backend           Shows how OOP and Design Patterns work together in the code.
Synchronous Frontend design with backend                                     Implement a frontend that communicates with the backend.
Software Functional Testing for backend coding                               Unit testing of backend logic. Tools: Mocha,Chai.
Sofware Testing through POSTMAN                                              ‚Ä¢ Build a Postman Collection, Test CRUD APIs (create job, list jobs, get status, retry job, etc.).
                                                                             ‚Ä¢ Export collection for submission.
Team Collaboration via GitHub                                                Create a GitHub repository for the project and do teamwork for pushing, pulling, branching, and resolving conflicts.
Deploy your project in AWS                                                   CI/CD Pipeline
Document Usage                                                               Make a complete report based on provided
template

Task 1: Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

‚Ä¢ Write a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document that includes:
o Purpose ‚Äì Why the system is being developed.
o Problem Statement
o Scope ‚Äì Overview of the product, its goals, and benefits.
o User Characteristics ‚Äì Target users and their needs.
o Constraints ‚Äì Limitations like regulatory, hardware, or technology
restrictions.
o Functional Requirements ‚Äì Detailed description of system functions (e.g.,
‚ÄúThe system shall allow users to log in with email and password‚Äù).
o Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) ‚Äì Performance, reliability, security,
usability, scalability.
o User interface mockups/wireframes (Low Fidelity Design)
o Complete System Diagram
o Safety Considerations.
o Risk Management

Task 2: UI/UX Design and Prototyping Using Figma - 8

‚Ä¢ Based on the SRS and Low Fidelity Design, design the User Interface (UI) in Figma.
‚Ä¢ Share the link with your peers and collaborate (we will check individual contributions).
‚Ä¢ Do prototyping on your design and share the production level URL in the report
‚Ä¢ Share the link to the Figma project in report.

Task 3: Implementation (Coding) Using Design Pattern and OOP Principles Using the following Matrix. (You must extend two more epics in your group project)

3.1 Design Pattern Selection Matrix (Example usages)

Example Project Feature 
Suggested Design Pattern 
How to Use It 
Integrating multiple sandbox 
payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, 
PayPal) 
Adapter 
Create a common interface to 
interact with different external 
services 
Allowing users to customize 
dashboards with widgets 
Decorator 
Wrap base dashboard objects 
with additional features like 
graphs, alerts, etc. 
Hiding system complexity and 
giving a clean interface (e.g., 
project management module) 
Facade 
Combine submodules like 
TaskManager, Calendar, and 
Notifier behind a single 
interface 
Dynamically creating objects 
for users (Admin, Member, 
Guest) 
Factory 
Return specific user class 
based on role or credentials 
Handling request pipeline (e.g., 
request logging, validation, 
authentication) 
Middleware / Chain of 
Responsibility 
Each middleware processes 
the request and passes it to the 
next handler 
Broadcasting updates (e.g., task 
assigned, message sent) Observer 
Notify all observers (e.g., team 
members) when a change 
occurs 
Duplicating object 
configurations (e.g., template 
settings, profiles) 
Prototype 
Clone an existing object with 
the same settings instead of 
rebuilding from scratch 
Restricting access to sensitive 
data (e.g., only Admins can 
view financials) 
Proxy 
Use a proxy to control access 
to sensitive operations based 
on role 
Application configuration or 
logging instance Singleton 
One instance of configuration 
or logger throughout the 
project 
Switching between strategies at 
runtime (e.g., sorting by date, 
priority, or status) 
Strategy 
Define interchangeable sorting 
or filtering strategies and 
switch them as needed

3.2 Implementation Using OOP Principles

Step                                   What to Do                                                                                           Why It Matters 
Apply OOP Concepts                     Use these basic concepts:                                                                            Makes your code clean, indented, reusable, and easy to maintain.        
                                       ‚Ä¢ Classes & Objects ‚Äì to represent things like User, Project, Task      
                                       ‚Ä¢ Inheritance ‚Äì for code reuse (e.g., Admin and Member both inherit from User)  
                                       ‚Ä¢ Encapsulation ‚Äì keep internal logic hidden  
                                       ‚Ä¢ Polymorphism ‚Äì same method, different behavior (Use of method overloading and overriding) 


You Must include: 

‚Ä¢ At least 5 interacting classes with the implementation of OOP principles (inherence, 
polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction). Each class should implement at least one 
OOP principals. 
‚Ä¢ Use of at least 7 design patterns 
‚Ä¢ In report, you must explain the following: 
 
OOP Explanation:

o -Why you defined each class  
o -Where inheritance is used  
o -How encapsulation is applied  
o -Where polymorphism appears 

Design Pattern Explanation:  

o Which 7 patterns were used  
o Where they are used in your code  
o Why each pattern fits your problem 

Task 4: Team Collaboration via GitHub 

‚Ä¢ Create a new GitHub repository for the project 
‚Ä¢ Share your project to your team members 
‚Ä¢ Use branches for feature development 
‚Ä¢ Use pulls requests and code reviews for other members of your project 
‚Ä¢ Practice merging conflicts and mention it in the report (Minimum 2) 
‚Ä¢ Maintain a README.md with setup instructions 
‚Ä¢ We will check all commits which are initiated by different team members. 

Task 5: Functional Testing (only unit testing) 

‚Ä¢ Test each of your backend functionality (such as create task, update task, etc.) using unit 
testing 

Task 6: API Testing using Postman 

‚Ä¢ Test the endpoint of your backends functionality using Postman  
‚Ä¢ Screenshots of Postman test cases or Swagger documentation (If we cover) 
Example Endpoints to Test (It must be based on your project): 
‚Ä¢ POST /login 
‚Ä¢ GET /users 
‚Ä¢ POST /notifications 
‚Ä¢ PUT /settings/{id} 
‚Ä¢ DELETE /account/{id}
